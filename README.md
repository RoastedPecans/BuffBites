Home of BuffBites, my final C++ Project for CSCI 2270.

## Explanation
This project uses C++ along with a website (as of right now https://farrandorder.me) in order to simulate an online ordering system for the CU Boulder dining halls. Users can register, login, and create an order which then gets sent to the database via POST Request. "Workers" at the various dining halls can then login and view the current orders they need to fill.
